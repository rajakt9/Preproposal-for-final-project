# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
TODO
I am still not fully decided between these two but as of the momoent these are my ideas.

1. Working on some sort of project in which I use python to generate  music/melodies with Python using FL studio or other music production programs.
2. working on some sort of program that can predict stock prices or trends with data sets or predicting info.
3. Using Python to create some sort of playable game (most likely a game that cheats.)

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
TODO
I plan to probably work by myself on this 

## Do you have any questions of your own?
TODO
None for the moment
